# EM Lab03: TensorFlow vs PyTorch

This repository contains the implementation and comparison of a simple neural network trained on the MNIST dataset using both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. It was developed as part of the **Embedded Machine Learning Lab (EM Lab03)** at TH Deggendorf â€“ Campus Cham, under the guidance of **Prof. Tobias Schaffer**.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

* Build and train the same neural network in both TensorFlow and PyTorch
* Compare training time and performance
* Convert the models for embedded deployment:

  * **TensorFlow Lite** (`.tflite`)
  * **ONNX** (`.onnx`)

---

## ðŸ’  Lab Tasks

### 1. Model Implementation and Training

* Load and preprocess MNIST dataset (28Ã—28 grayscale images)
* Define a simple architecture:

  * Input layer (784 features)
  * Dense layer with 64 ReLU units
  * Output layer with 10 classes
* Train for 5 epochs
* Measure training time

### 2. Inference and Evaluation

* Run inference on test set
* Measure test accuracy and inference time

### 3. Model Conversion

* Export trained TensorFlow model to **TensorFlow Lite**
* Export trained PyTorch model to **ONNX**
